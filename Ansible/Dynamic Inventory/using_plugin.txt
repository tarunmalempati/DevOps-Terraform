Here's an example of how you might configure a dynamic inventory using the AWS EC2 plugin:  
Requirements: AWS CLI to be installed

1. Install boto3 and botocore:    

pip install boto3 botocore  

2. Create a Configuration File:
Create a file named aws_ec2.yaml with the following content. You should name the file as aws_ec2.yml or aws_ec2.yaml only.

plugin: aws_ec2
regions:
  - ap-south-1
filters:
  instance-state-name: running

3. Run Ansible with Dynamic Inventory:
Use the -i option to specify the dynamic inventory file:

ansible-inventory -i aws_ec2.yml --graph

This will query AWS for running EC2 instances in the ap-south-1 region and use them as the inventory for Ansible.

4. Execute a Sample Command
Run a sample command to ping all instances in the dynamic inventory:

ansible -i aws_ec2.yml -m ping all

This command will use the aws_ec2.yml configuration to dynamically fetch the list of running EC2 instances in the ap-south-1 region and then run the ping module on all of them.
